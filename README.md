# GIS Project Proposal
## Mapping PPCP contamination in Maryland
### Topic 
I intend to map sites of reported PPCP contamination in Maryland, providing a visual representation for the public of areas of concern. I will map **where contamination has been reported**, **which contaminants** and **what concentrations** have been detected. 
### Data 
I will make use primarily of data collected by NOAA on [PPCP contamination in the tissue of oysters](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/20268) in the Cheseapeake Bay Region. I may also examine other data sources relevant to the topic.
