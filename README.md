# GIS Project Proposal
## Mapping Contamination from Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) in Maryland
### Topic 
I intend to map sites of reported PPCP contamination in Maryland, providing a visual representation for the public of areas of concern. I will map **sites where contamination has been reported**, along with **which contaminants** and **what concentrations** have been detected. 
### Data 
I will make use primarily of data collected by NOAA on [PPCP contamination in the tissue of oysters](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/20268) in the Cheseapeake Bay. I may also examine other data sources relevant to the topic, such as this study by Arikan et al. (2008) on [antibiotics and hormones in the Choptank River](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0011916408001434).
### Transformations
NOAA collected samples of oysters at seven sites along the Chesapeake. I will aggregate the date by **collection site** and **class/purpose** of drugs, for example, antibiotics, painkillers, or antidepressants
### Analysis
Additionally, I will map nearby wastewater treatment plants and agricultural zones. I will examine whether WWTPs or intensive agriculture may be responsible for higher concentrations of PPCPs.
### Outputs
I will produce a series of maps organized by drug class/purpose detailing the sites of PPCP contamination.
